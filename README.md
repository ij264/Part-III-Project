# Part-III-Project
This is my Part III project where I have investigated the dynamics of relativistic electrons in Saturn's radiation belt. The code written here allows the User to numerically simulate the orbit of an electron under an electric and magnetic field. 

1. Input correct path for saving the outputs. 
2. Run Hao.orbits in main.ipynb with the relevant parameters. 

If you want to change the electric field, it can be changed in Hao.Orbits
